,194,what is serology testing and can i be tested using this method,Center for Disease Control,"serology testing checks a sample of a persons blood to look for antibodies to covid, the virus that causes covid. these antibodies are produced when someone has been infected, so a positive result from this test indicates that person was previously infected with the virus. "
,195,what should people at higher risk of serious illness with covid do,Center for Disease Control,"if there is an outbreak in your community, stay home as much as possible. watch for symptoms and emergency signs. if you get sick, stay home and call your doctor. "

,206,how frequently should facilities be cleaned to reduce the potential spread of covid,Center for Disease Control,"surfaces frequently touched by multiple people, such as door handles, bathroom surfaces, and handrails, should be cleaned with soap and water or another detergent at least daily when facilities are in use. more frequent cleaning and disinfection may be required based on level of use. "
,207,is cleaning alone effective against the virus that causes covid,Center for Disease Control,"cleaning does not kill germs, but by removing them, it lowers their numbers and the risk of spreading infection. "
,208,who should clean and disinfect community spaces,Center for Disease Control,regular cleaning staff can clean and disinfect community spaces.
,209,how long do companies need to close for disinfection after an exposure,Center for Disease Control,companies do not necessarily need to close after a person with confirmed or suspected covid has been in a company facility.
,211,how long before other workers can come back to work,Center for Disease Control,workers without close contact with the person with confirmed or suspected covid can return to work immediately after disinfection is completed.
,212,should outdoor playgrounds be cleaned and disinfected to prevent covid,Center for Disease Control,outdoor areas generally require normal routine cleaning and do not require disinfection.
,213,can sanitizing tunnels be used at building entrances or exits to prevent the spread of covid,Center for Disease Control,cdc does not recommend the use of sanitizing tunnels.
,214,should sidewalks and roads be disinfected to prevent covid,Center for Disease Control,cdc does not recommend disinfection of sidewalks or roads.
,215,should i avoid contact with pets or other animals if i am sick with covid,Center for Disease Control,"until we learn more about this new covid, you should restrict contact with pets and other animals while you are sick with covid, just like you would with people. "
,217,what should i do if my pet gets sick and i think its covid,Center for Disease Control,"if your pet gets sick after contact with a person with covid, do not take your pet to the veterinary clinic yourself. "
,218,why are animals being tested when many people cant get tested,Center for Disease Control,animals are only being tested in very rare circumstances. routine testing of animals is not recommended at this time.
,219,are import animals and animal products safe,Center for Disease Control,cdc does not have any evidence to suggest that imported animals or animal products pose a risk for spreading covid in the united states.
,220,what precautions should be taken for animals that have recently been imported from outside the united states,Center for Disease Control,"as with any animal introduced to a new environment, animals recently imported should be observed daily for signs of illness. if an animal becomes ill, the animal should be examined by a veterinarian.
