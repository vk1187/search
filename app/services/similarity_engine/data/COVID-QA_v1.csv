,194,what is serology testing and can i be tested using this method,Center for Disease Control,"serology testing checks a sample of a persons blood to look for antibodies to covid, the virus that causes covid. these antibodies are produced when someone has been infected, so a positive result from this test indicates that person was previously infected with the virus.
